    "description": "<p><span><span>This group is for ladies in their mid 20's and mid 30's who live in the Walnut Creek area (Pleasant Hill, Lafayette, Concord, Claycord, Danville, etc).&nbsp;</span></span><span>Meet new girl friends, develop a new circle of friends, and participate in a multitude of local activities.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Its not easy to make new friends after your early 20's, especially if one relocates, is a momma, or has a demanding job, etc. &nbsp;</span><span>We know that the idea of meeting new people in a group can be scary, but we promise everyone is extremely nice and open to meeting new people...and we often have plenty of new ladies to get to know!&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>And occasionally, since we don't live in a bubble, we'll have an event open to husbands, boyfriends, friends, etc.</span></p>\n<p><span><span><b>What kind of activities do you do?</b></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Events like happy hours, movies, potlucks, book club, brunch, picnics, wine tastings, festivals, food truck events, dog walking, hiking, dinners, evening walks, coffee, yoga, bar trivia nights, etc. are a regular occurrence.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p><span>We do try to have at least 4-5 events per month, so hopefully you will find something that peaks your interest. We are always open to new ideas as well and encourage members host events with our co- organizers.</span></p>\n<p><span><b>What's up with the $4.00 annual fee?</b></span><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Most people don't know that meet up charges a fee to run our group! This fee at the&nbsp;</span>moment<span>&nbsp;is $140.00 a year. If we all pitch in $4.00 for the year <i>(33 cents a month!) </i>we'll have more than enough to cover the meet up costs.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Anything left over will ALWAYS be used for our group. &nbsp;This will help cover expenses for people hosting potlucks, (paper plates, napkins,utensils, wine, drinks, food, carpooling, art supplies etc). &nbsp;Any funds left over will be used for annual parties where everything is paid for!</span></p>\n<p>In the end, $4 bucks is what most of us spend on a small latte, so pushing that tiny amount of cash towards the group will help us keep us running!</p>\n<p>There is of course no fee to join the group! We want you to see the awesome events we throw, and make sure you're interested in participating! Once you RSVP for an event, meet up will request payment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>What happens after I RSVP to an event?</b></p>\n<p>1-2 days before the event, you will receive a reminder email from the host. The email contains important info such a specific meeting place, address, directions, and personal host contact info. &nbsp;If you do not receive this email, please check your spam and check that you have allowed meet up to send you messages. You can always personal message the event host thru meet up as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span><b>Is it OK to cancel last minute or not show up to an event?</b></span></p>\n<p><span>We know, We know. It's just too easy to click the \"Yes\" RSVP button even if you have no clue about whether or not you'll really be able to make it, but here's the thing: When the day of the event rolls around, those of us who actually make the trip will be standing there waiting around for you.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>We'll be wondering,&nbsp;<i>\"WHERE IS MARY-STU? Should we start the event without her? Is she lost? Should we wait another ten minutes?\"</i>&nbsp;Not only is it inconvenient, but it's rude to the organizers and other members who are waiting for the event to start.</span></p>\n<p>We all know life happens and some things cannot be avoided, but being a serial \u201cno show\u201d or last min canceller may constitute us removing you from the group. In addition, some events fill up fast, and if you no show, or cancel last min it means another person on the waitlist, isn't able to attend. &nbsp;We are all busy women and we hope this will make our group more organized and reliable.</p>\n<p><span><b>Will I be removed if I don't attend for awhile?</b></span></p>\n<p><span>We ask that all members attend at least one event within 6 months. If you&nbsp;haven't&nbsp;attended an event in 6&nbsp;months, we may remove you from the group. Please know there's no hard feelings,&nbsp;everyone&nbsp;gets busy, but we try and keep a&nbsp;member list of active members. Of course you are always welcome to join again! <br></span></p>\n<p><span>Also, meet up charges us based on our group numbers, so keeping 100 inactive members drives up the cost of meet up for everyone.</span></p>\n<p><span>Now that that blah blah is outta the way, we look forward to you joining the group and meeting some great girls! Looking forward to meeting you!</span></p>\n<p> <br></p>",

Extra discs and cones are a plus, but we have enough.</p>\n<p>RSVPs for those planning to attend (not those who regretfully cannot participate) are encouraged, as it helps us determine whether there are enough people to have a game, especially as some folk come from far awayto play, so please keep your status up to date.</p>\n<p>Civic Park is a free public park, and space is not reserved. Though space is shared with other members of the public, we have not had trouble with games at this time.</p>\n<p>Dues for this Meetup:&nbsp; We welcome contributions to help defray the small cost of Meetup. &nbsp; <br></p>\n<p>Thank you for reading, and we look forward to seeing you on the field! </p>",

Who couldn't use another friend right?&nbsp;Developing new friendships, and<strong>&nbsp;supporting one another while having fun</strong> is what we are about.&nbsp;In our 40's-50's many of us have been through many life transitions. We are&nbsp;single, married, with significant others, divorced (or going through one), or widowers. Some of us are new to the area, while others have lived here for a while. </p>\n<p>We strive to&nbsp;have&nbsp;a <em>\"drama-free\",</em> fun and informal&nbsp;environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our goal is for you to reach out and get to know one another to find common interests with other amazing gals so&nbsp;you can also get together outside of the meet up and develop long term friendships. We ask that you introduce yourself to one another and also help welcome newcomers by introducing them. <strong>If you are a little on the shy side, please privately message JoAnn Horner&nbsp;for a one-on-one or a smaller intro to a few of the \"regular\" attendees.</strong> </p>\n<p>We are working towards providing a&nbsp;variety for everyone&nbsp;that range from low&nbsp;or no cost to a day or overnight excursion.&nbsp;We welcome your ideas as well.</p>\n<p>Many events will be in the surrounding Walnut Creek and Tri-Valley areas as well as Benicia. Some examples are Coffee/Tea, Happy Hours, Dinner, Brunch, Mid-week lunches, outlet shopping, wine-tasting, spa day, beer tasting, day trips to the ocean, movies, bowling, game night,&nbsp;paint nights, hiking, coffee/tea, dancing, festivals, concerts, bands, art/craft events,&nbsp;etc. </p>\n<p>Join our Facebook Group: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/WalnutCreekGirlfriends/\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/WalnutCreekGirlfriends/</a>&nbsp;where you can post suggestions or get a last minute group together for something fun.</p>\n<p>Please also periodically visit our \"Polls\"</p>\n<p>\"Cheers!\" JoAnn Horner&nbsp;&amp; Mabel Perez-Haines &nbsp;and the rest of the \"Girlfriend\" family.</p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p> <br></p>",

Sportsmanship, teamwork and fair play are the most critical components of UF and a must for anyone who decides to compete.&nbsp; We have a code of conduct and we're serious about it. </p>\n<p>For night games, we charge $5 to cover the fees for the lights and any additional money goes to our charitable efforts.&nbsp; Once a month, we'll have a GRATEFUL GAME where players are asked to contribut $5 each for charity.</p>\n<p> In 2014, we raised&nbsp;just over&nbsp;$7,100 to help the Lazarex Cancer Foundation (<a href=\"http://www.lazarex.org\">www.lazarex.org</a>).&nbsp; That money was raised through optional player donations.&nbsp; In 2015, we raised $2,500 and provided 112 ($5,000) worth of microloans across the world through <a href=\"http://www.kiva.org\">www.kiva.org</a></p>\n<p>To learn more and get on our invite list,&nbsp;e-mail, call or text&nbsp;Aaron Davis at adavis35@hotmail.com or 925.323.9409.</p>\n<p> <strong>How we play:</strong></p>\n<p> 1.&nbsp; If you don't know how to play, we'll teach you.&nbsp; Everyone&nbsp;is welcome!</p>\n<p>2.&nbsp; Good sportsmanship, safety and respect for the game rules is absolutely non-negotiable.&nbsp; Ultimate Football is meant to be be fun and competitive for all players.</p>\n<p> 3.&nbsp; We start and end each game as friends and we treat eachother with respect.&nbsp; We help eachother on the field and we keep the comments positive and we involve everyone in the game.</p>\n<p> 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;We show up on&nbsp;time, ready to play and we&nbsp;keep our status updated if our plans have&nbsp;change.</p>\n<p> 5.&nbsp; Hope to see you on the field.&nbsp; Ultimate is great fun and exercise!</p>",

Most of us are in our 30s, 40s and 50s and want to have as much fun as we did in college, but more responsibly! &nbsp;We love to try new wines, sample different microbrews, meet for happy hours, and explore the beauty of California outdoors through hikes and camping trips while making friends and sharing fun times. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>As an example of future events that aren't yet on the calendar, we've already reserved a large group campsite on a beautiful lake at the end of summer 2016! &nbsp;We can swim, kayak, float on rafts, hike or just hang out. &nbsp;When the sun sets we'll build a bonfire and enjoy happy hour. &nbsp;We will eat, drink and dance to our favorite playlists until the park ranger asks us to stop the festivities at quiet hour. &nbsp; I'll post details by the end of this summer. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>There are lots of new events in the planning stage so please visit the site again soon. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Looking forward to having fun with you all,</span></p>\n<p><span>Fun Friends Organizers &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>",

    "description": "Hi there!\r\n\r\nThe Walnut Creek Area Dining Out Meetup is about a few things:\r\n\r\n1. People. We're all social people who enjoy making new freinds and having a good time and that's the first goal of our meetups. \r\n2. Good food. Whether it be an exciting new restaurant, ethnic food, high-end or a cheap-eat, or simply an easy favorite, this group is about enjoying food.  If there's a place you love, send a suggestion and we'll get it on the schedule!\r\n3. Expand our world - whether through food, or people or through the mere act of getting out and doing something you might not normally do, getting together with a group of new people and getting to know each other is expanding your life beyond it's current place.  \r\n4. Fun!  Most importantly, we're here to have fun.  This is an easy, pressure free way to have a good time relax, socialize, party, indulge... it's whatever we make it.\r\n\r\nWe'll aim for Thurs/Fri/Saturday meetups, but we're also going to have weekday meetups as well.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we won't always be having full \"dinner\" meetups.  Let's be honest - some of us enjoy a good plate of nachos over a couple of beers and cocktails.  Check our the calendar and see what's coming up!",

We can meet at one of the many parks around and hang out, have potlucks, and maybe later when the babies are a little older have a girls night out. Despite the (historical) name of the group, dads are welcome too, although there might be some women only events occasionally.  Older siblings are welcome too, but events will be focused on the little ones.</p>\n<p>We tend to have more events during the weekdays, but I'm open to suggestions.  I can't wait to meet you and your baby!</p>\n<p>There is a mostly parallel facebook group run by the previous organizer of this group.

    "description": "<p>Mindful Meditation for Recovery - Meeting since mid-October, 2015, now open to Meetup members. <br></p>\n<p>Mondays, 6:30 to 7:30 PM Walnut Creek United Methodist, 1543 Sunnyvale Ave, Walnut Creek, Wesley Room (102-B) <br></p>\n<p>This group is for those involved in 12 Step recovery from any addiction who want to deepen their 11th Step program and are open to the meditation practices drawn from the rich tradition of Buddhism. Mindfulness meditation (also known as Insight Meditation or Vipassana) will be taught through guided exercises, talks, and readings. These practices and principles are uniquely applicable to the challenges of recovery. They teach us to sit with calm and serenity within the movements of the often troublesome mind that calls out for relief from discomfort. Rather than medicating with substances or compulsive behaviors, we learn to observe the mind and body with equanimity - balance - and find the freedom from the formerly automatic acting-out of our addictions. <br></p>\n<p>This group is about: <br></p>\n<p>Learning effective meditation techniques through guided practice \u2022 Fellowship &amp; support to strengthen your meditation program \u2022 Information incorporating Buddhist principles with the 12 Steps \u2022 Access to a lending library of CDs, books, and online materials <br></p>\n<p>What we do: \u2022 Practice 20 guided meditation exercises to help establish physical and mental calm, concentration, and insights into ourselves about \u201chow things work\u201d. \u2022 Read or listen to materials that offer instruction on mindfulness, and suggestions about integrating these Buddhist derived principles and practices with those of the 12 Steps. \u2022 Share experiences about our meditation and spiritual programs and learn from each other about what works. <br></p>\n<p>There are members who are not a part of the Meetup group, so don't be put off if you see only 1 or 2 Meetup members signed up for an event, others will be there. This is an ongoing group; there\u2019s no need to sign up, just show up! But your positive comments on Meetup are welcome to let others know what it was like:) <br></p>\n<p>The group is supported by participant donations to cover rent and supplies. Questions?

All dues collected above the cost of Meetup fees will be used for a party. We are on a May &amp; November payment schedule so the party will be held in October with plans of having a zero balance prior to the November payment.

    "description": "<p><strong>real women. real harmony. real fun.</strong></p>\n<p>We are a group of fun-loving women, ages 18-80, who sing four-part, a cappella harmony in the barbershop style. Our members travel from near and far (Pacifica, Dixon &amp; San Jose!) to join our voices in song. Please join us for a rehearsal if you'd like to add your voice to our barbershop chords! Our auditions are ongoing, and no experience is required. We embrace all members, beginners to advanced musicians, and our music team is able to teach at all levels. Access to learning tracks and sheet music is available for all of our songs. We perform several times a year: a show each winter, regional competition in the spring, and singing the National Anthem at an A's game during the summer! We rehearse on Tuesday nights at 7:15 pm in Walnut Creek, and all are welcome to join us!</p>\n<p>Learn more at singdvc.com. If you have any questions, email us at diablovistainfo@gmail.com.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>Who we are:</strong><br>\n\n<br>\n\n It\u2019s difficult to meet other people while caught up with our careers, in grad school, or while in job transition.</p>\n<p>So instead of staying in, why not go out, meet new people, make new friends, try new things, and see new places?<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">This group is for Young Professionals (single or not) in their 20s and 30s who are keen to expand their circle of friends</span>, have a good time socializing, appreciating good conversation and enjoying the area.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n <em>Although a majority of our members are single, those who are couples comprise a smaller portion of this group.</em><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>Our activities:</strong><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">Activities in this Meetup are mostly concentrated in the East Bay</span> (Alameda, Berkeley, Concord, Dublin, Oakland, Pleasant Hill, Walnut Creek), <span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">but also veer into the City and the South Bay.</span><br>\n\n<br>\n\n Our Meetups range from outdoor activities such as hiking, bbqs, sports lessons and wine tasting to happy hours, dining out and movies, as well as exploring local festivals, museums, theater, and live music.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n If you have additional suggestions as to which types of activities we should schedule, please feel free to post your ideas on the  <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Young-Professional-s-Social-Group-20s-to-30s/#making\" style=\"color : #816940\">'Suggest A Meetup'</a> page. <span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">If you have attended 5 or more events within 3 months, you are eligible to host your 'Suggested' Event!</span><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <span style=\"color : #0000ff\"><em>We ask that when you say that you are 'Going,' please take responsibility for attending events for which you sign up as a courtesy toward fellow members, event hosts/organizers, and venues that accommodate our group.</em></span><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <strong>Our goals:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Establish <span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">positive relationships</span>.</li>\n<li>Organize <span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">safe and fun</span> events that encourage everyone to feel welcome and comfortable.</li>\n<li>Create an environment that is open to lively activities and discussions while <span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">respecting others</span>.</li>\n<li>Be <span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">open minded</span> to meeting all types of people, regardless of gender, race, religion, and orientation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color : #0000ff\"><strong><br>\n\n <span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">PLEASE READ OUR 3 EASY RULES : )</span></strong></span><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <span style=\"color : #0000ff\"><strong>1. RSVP Policy:</strong></span> 3 'No Shows' to an event, and you are OUT! A 'No Show' constitutes as flaking 1 hour prior to the meetup or just not showing up, without informing the Organizer.<strong><br>\n\n<br>\n\n <span style=\"color : #0000ff\">2. Profile photo and first name required:</span></strong> We have found that having a face to put with a name makes the group safer. Photos of you being active or with your friends are great, but if we don't have an <span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">easily identifiable solo photo of you</span>, we won't be able to easily find you in a group. If you do not wish to post your photo, please contact the organizers and we will work with your special circumstances.<br>\n\n <strong><br>\n\n <span style=\"color : #0000ff\">3. Event Fees:</span></strong> At certain events, we will ask for a donation/fee. Why do we charge event fees? Meetup charges the Organizer a monthly fee to maintain the group (We do not work for Meetup). It also takes Organizers a lot of time to create great events, make reservations, coordinate with business owners, secure venues and make other accommodations.<strong><br>\n\n</strong></p>",

We hold free monthly meetings in&nbsp;<b>San Francisco, San Mateo, Fremont&nbsp;</b>and<b>&nbsp;San Jose, </b>and&nbsp;<b>Online</b>&nbsp;(through webinars), so everyone is welcome to join.</p>\n<p><b>WE ARE OPPORTUNISTIC:</b>&nbsp;In case you haven't noticed, the Multi-Family industry is benefiting from a once in a lifetime investor opportunity - The Millennial generation are less interested in buying homes than any previous generation, raising demand, stability and profit for Multifamily investors.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/2/3/9/600_446468761.jpeg\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/2/4/4/600_446468772.jpeg\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/2/5/3/600_446468787.jpeg\"></p>\n<p><b>WE PROVIDE EDUCATION:</b>&nbsp;Our Meetup piggybacks on this mega-trend, and provides Multi-family education, networking and deal exposure to encourage investment in Multi-family properties in many states.&nbsp;Whether you plan on setting up and running your own Multi-Family projects or want to invest passively in someone else's deal, this Meetup is the place to be.</p>\n<p><b>WE PROVIDE ACCESS:&nbsp;</b>If you are lucky enough an accredited investor as defined by the SEC, you probably have access to some of these Multifamily projects.&nbsp;If you don't meet those qualifications, you can gain access to these awesome investment opportunities by getting educated and forging a relationship with deal organizers.</p>\n<p>These are institutional type investments accessible only by grouping investment funds (unless you have very deep pockets). Multi-family is the investment of choice these days for all manner of institutional investors. Why? Because they are one of the most reliable and high-yielding investments out there.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>THE RETURNS ARE EXCELLENT:</b>&nbsp;Multifamily investments returns typically outperform stock markets and single family investments. If you are still investing in CDs, Bonds or similar investments, take a look at the graphic below to see what an amazing difference higher return opportunities make to your quest for financial freedom.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/2/7/6/600_446468822.jpeg\"></p>\n<p><b>WE KNOW A SECRET:</b> Don't tell anyone, but Multi-family investments create wealth almost magically. Unlike single family homes, Multi-family properties are primarily valued based on Net Operating Income. Even a tiny increase in Net Operating Income can create an enormous increase in net worth for the investors. Take a look at the typical example below. This isn't pie-in-the-sky math, it happens in Multi-family investing extremely regularly.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/2/8/2/600_446468834.jpeg\"></p>\n<p><b>WE HAVE THE TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE:</b>&nbsp;It takes both training and experience to make it all come together and work.&nbsp;With decades of collective experience, our organizer team has extensively training in multi-family and can guide you. Whether you are looking for great passive investments, support in buying your own property, or assistance putting your own projects together, we have the resources available within this group.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We look forward to having you join us in this exciting, dynamic, profitable group! &nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>JOIN US TODAY FOR FREE EDUCATION, NETWORKING AND INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES.&nbsp;</b></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/2/a/e/600_446468878.jpeg\"></p>\n<p> <br></p>",

Whether you\u2019re a skier/snowboarder, or you simply want to meet fun active singles, you have found the right group, the Rusty Bindings Ski Club. We ski regularly in Tahoe and further afield. <br> <br> The East Bay Ski &amp; Snowboard Meetup Group is your link to the Rusty Bindings Ski Club, based in Walnut Creek, CA. Meetup members get notifications of Club social events and meetings, which include TGIF\u2019s and other year-round social and sporting / activity events, which you are welcome to attend. By attending these FREE events, you can meet other outdoor enthusiasts who are likely to be members of the Club.</p>\n<p>Rusty Bindings Ski Club is one of four San Francisco Bay Area Singles League ski clubs affiliated with the Bay Area Snow Sports Council (BAC)&nbsp;and the Far West Ski Association (FWSA) and is open to singles over 21. We offer an active winter ski schedule for recreational skiers, downhill racers and snowboarders, snowshoeing and cross country skiing, as well as a year-round social program with a variety of activities including bicycling, volleyball, waterskiing, sailing, scuba diving, camping, rafting, softball, tennis, golf, dancing, wine tasting, theater, concerts, picnics, parties and many other activities including trips all over the world (through FWSA).

The team has an excellent program with ski and race clinics, orientation for new skiers, discounted accommodations and lift tickets, awards, gifts and an opportunity to ski and race with others of the same skiing ability. Our members range from 20 something on up, with equal numbers of men and women. You don\u2019t even have to ski to join our club as many members joined to participate in our year-round activities with other active singles. <br> <br> Click on our&nbsp;activities calendar&nbsp;to see our upcoming activities.

Being a new stay at home mom myself, I really wanted a safe and clean environment for my little one to play (that won't break the bank either). This group is open to moms that have the ability to offer their home as a place to host a meet up in a small group setting (maybe 5 kids at a time to start or smaller) whichever works for you. We will try to have 1 meet up a week at each others house so that the little ones have a safe place to play and can learn to share their toys with others. There are a lot of meet up groups at parks, cafes, stroller walks, and many more places but I wanted to start a group that is interested in getting to know one another more on a personal level. This way we can build lasting friendships for us and the kids.</p>\n<p>Since we have different age groups I kept the meet up from 1 - 2 1/2 year olds. This way we have age appropriate toys for each child. Maybe once we get a few members who are interested with younger or older children we can match the ages with the appropriate members. Please feel free to reach out to me with any ideas, questions, or if you would like to help out in any way. This group will be 50 members or less to establish quality friendships (quality over quanity).</p>",
